Material Orientation
--------------------

Probabilistic risk and reliability analyses provide methods for integrating the contribution of all contributors to ultimate system performance. They also permit the effects of uncertainties to be reflected directly in the understanding of system outcomes. In order to do this correctly, a good understanding of probabilistic concepts and methods is essential. This subject covers all of these topics.
